This repository hosts files for my portfolio website.

>> A portfolio website shows information about one's best works and introduces others 
to the things you care about.
The Website has two pages: 

h1>> Home --> This is the landing page, which contains a serial image/illustration 
and contact information as well as a short write-up of my interests.
h2>> About Me --> This contains details about my experience, portfolio and 
collaborations and partnerships.
